# 3D-FDTD-Plane-Wave-MATLAB
## 3-D Finite Difference Time Domain Methods for plane wave propagation in a vacuum. 

* This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of 3-D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods for simulating the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in a vacuum. The FDTD method is a powerful numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in time domain, widely used in computational electromagnetics.
